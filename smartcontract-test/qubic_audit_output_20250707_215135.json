  "functional_spec": "# HM25 Qubic Smart Contract Functional Specification\n\n## Introduction\n\n### Objective\nThe HM25 smart contract is designed to demonstrate foundational functionality on the Qubic platform. It provides basic procedures for state management, invocation reward handling, and statistics retrieval. The contract serves as a template for understanding core Qubic smart contract operations, including state tracking and reward mechanisms.\n\n### Context\nHM25 operates within the Qubic ecosystem, leveraging the Qubic Platform Interface (QPI) to manage contract state and interact with the Qubic system. The contract implements two primary procedures (Echo and Burn) and one function (GetStats) to track and manage invocation rewards and usage statistics.\n\n### Core Principles\n1. **State Management**: The contract maintains internal state to track the number of Echo and Burn procedure calls.\n2. **Invocation Reward Handling**: The contract demonstrates two approaches for managing invocation rewards:\n   - **Echo Procedure**: Transfers the reward back to the invocator.\n   - **Burn Procedure**: Removes the reward from circulation.\n3. **Transparency**: The GetStats function provides visibility into contract usage statistics.\n4. **Modularity**: The contract is structured to allow for future enhancements and additional functionality.\n\n### Input Format\nThe contract currently implements procedures and functions with empty input structs. This design allows for future extensibility. The input formats are as follows:\n\n| Procedure/Function | Input Struct | Description |\n|---------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Echo               | `Echo_input` | Currently empty. Reserved for future use. |\n| Burn               | `Burn_input` | Currently empty. Reserved for future use. |\n| GetStats           | `GetStats_input` | Currently empty. Reserved for future use. |\n\nThe contract's output formats are defined for the GetStats function, which returns usage statistics:\n\n| Output Field          | Type    | Description                     |\n|-----------------------|---------|---------------------------------|\n| `numberOfEchoCalls`  | `uint64`| Number of Echo procedure calls.  |\n| `numberOfBurnCalls`  | `uint64`| Number of Burn procedure calls.  |\n\nThis document provides a detailed overview of the HM25 contract's design, functionality, and implementation, serving as a foundation for understanding and extending its capabilities.",

  "detailed_documentation": "**Detailed Technical Section**\n\n### Objective\n\nThe objective of this contract is to demonstrate basic contract functionality and state management in the Qubic Platform Interface (QPI). It provides two procedures, `Echo` and `Burn`, and one function, `GetStats`, to showcase how to manage contract state and interact with the QPI.\n\n### Flow Diagram Text Explanation\n\nThe flow of this contract can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: When the contract is deployed, the `INITIALIZE` macro sets the state variables `numberOfEchoCalls` and `numberOfBurnCalls` to 0.\n2.  **Procedure Call**: When a user invokes the `Echo` or `Burn` procedure, the corresponding code block is executed.\n3.  **State Update**: The procedure increments the respective call counter (either `numberOfEchoCalls` or `numberOfBurnCalls`) and performs additional actions as specified in the procedure.\n4.  **GetStats Function Call**: When a user calls the `GetStats` function, it retrieves the current state of the contract by accessing the private state variables.\n5.  **Return Values**: The `GetStats` function returns the current state of the contract, including the number of times `Echo` and `Burn` procedures were called.\n\n### Accessed Data\n\nThe contract accesses the following data:\n\n*   **State Variables**:\n    *   `numberOfEchoCalls`: a private state variable to track the number of times the `Echo` procedure was called.\n    *   `numberOfBurnCalls`: a private state variable to track the number of times the `Burn` procedure was called.\n*   **QPI Types**:\n    *   `qpi.invocationReward()`: the invocation reward for the current transaction.\n    *   `qpi.invocator()`: the address of the invocator.\n*   **Input Parameters**:\n    *   `Echo_input`: an empty struct for the `Echo` procedure (currently empty).\n    *   `Burn_input`: an empty struct for the `Burn` procedure (currently empty).\n    *   `GetStats_input`: an empty struct for the `GetStats` function (currently empty).\n\n### Processing Logic\n\nThe contract's processing logic is as follows:\n\n*   **Echo Procedure**:\n    *   Increments the `numberOfEchoCalls` state variable.\n    *   Checks if an invocation reward is available and transfers it back to the invocator if so.\n*   **Burn Procedure**:\n    *   Increments the `numberOfBurnCalls` state variable.\n    *   Checks if an invocation reward is available and burns it (removes it from circulation) if so.\n*   **GetStats Function**:\n    *   Retrieves the current state of the contract by accessing the private state variables.\n    *   Returns the number of times `Echo` and `Burn` procedures were called.\n\n### Parameter Control and Edge Cases\n\nThe contract currently does not have any defined input parameters for the procedures and functions. However, it is recommended to add input validation and handling for edge cases once the inputs are defined.\n\nFor example:\n\n*   **Input Validation**: Validate the input parameters to ensure they meet the expected format and constraints.\n*   **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected situations, such as invalid input or internal errors.\n\n### Data Handling Rules (with tables)\n\n| Data Type | Description | Access Control |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `numberOfEchoCalls` | Private state variable to track the number of times the `Echo` procedure was called. | Read/Write |\n| `numberOfBurnCalls` | Private state variable to track the number of times the `Burn` procedure was called. | Read/Write |\n| `qpi.invocationReward()` | Invocation reward for the current transaction. | Read |\n| `qpi.invocator()` | Address of the invocator. | Read |\n| `Echo_input` | Empty struct for the `Echo` procedure. | Read |\n| `Burn_input` | Empty struct for the `Burn` procedure. | Read |\n| `GetStats_input` | Empty struct for the `GetStats` function. | Read |\n\nNote that this table only includes the data types and their descriptions. The actual implementation will depend on the specific requirements of the contract.\n\nIn conclusion, this contract provides a basic example of contract functionality and state management in the Qubic Platform Interface. It demonstrates how to create procedures and functions, manage contract state, and interact with the QPI. However, it is recommended to add input validation, error handling, and edge case handling to make the contract more robust and secure.",
  "audit_report": "**Audit Report:**\n\n**Contract Name:** HM25\n\n**Contract Type:** Smart Contract\n\n**Platform:** Qubic\n\n**Audit Date:** 07 July 2025\n\n**Auditor:** Qubic C++ Smart Contract Auditor\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe provided code for contract HM25 is a significantly improved version of the original code. The changes address all the feedback points, enhancing the code's readability, maintainability, and security. However, a thorough review reveals some potential security vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.\n\n**Security Vulnerabilities:**\n\n1. **Lack of Input Validation:** The current code does not perform any input validation, which can lead to security issues if malicious data is passed to the procedures or functions. It is recommended to add input validation as soon as inputs are defined.\n2. **Unprotected Procedures and Functions:** The `Echo` and `Burn` procedures, as well as the `GetStats` function, are not protected against unauthorized access. It is recommended to use access control mechanisms or authentication protocols to restrict access to these procedures and functions.\n3. **No Error Handling for QPI Operations:** The code does not handle errors that may occur during QPI operations, such as `qpi.invocationReward()` or `qpi.transfer()`. It is recommended to implement error handling mechanisms for these operations to prevent potential security issues.\n4. **Private Variable Access:** Although the private variables `numberOfEchoCalls` and `numberOfBurnCalls` are accessed using `this->`, it is still possible for an attacker to manipulate these variables directly. It is recommended to use getter functions to access these variables and to implement access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n**Risky Patterns:**\n\n1. **Use of `using namespace QPI;`:** The code uses the `using namespace QPI;` directive, which can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to maintain. It is recommended to use the `QPI::` prefix to access QPI types and functions.\n2. **Lack of Const-Correctness:** The code does not use const-correctness, which can lead to performance issues and code bugs. It is recommended to use const-correctness to ensure that functions and procedures do not modify data unnecessarily.\n\n**Optimization Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Use of QPI Functions:** The code uses QPI functions such as `qpi.invocationReward()` and `qpi.transfer()`. It is recommended to use these functions consistently throughout the code to ensure that the contract behaves as expected.\n2. **Use of Getter Functions:** The code uses getter functions to access private variables. It is recommended to use these functions consistently throughout the code to ensure that the contract behaves as expected.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Use of Descriptive Comments:** The code uses descriptive comments to explain the purpose of each procedure and function. It is recommended to use comments consistently throughout the code to ensure that the code is easy to understand and maintain.\n2. **Use of Unique IDs:** The code uses unique IDs for procedures and functions. It is recommended to use unique IDs consistently throughout the code to ensure that the contract behaves as expected.\n3. **Use of Access Control Mechanisms:** The code does not use access control mechanisms to restrict access to procedures and functions. It is recommended to use access control mechanisms to ensure that the contract behaves as expected.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\nBased on the audit report, the following recommendations are made:\n\n1. Implement input validation for procedures and functions.\n2. Use access control mechanisms to restrict access to procedures and functions.\n3. Implement error handling mechanisms for QPI operations.\n4. Use getter functions to access private variables.\n5. Use const-correctness to ensure that functions and procedures do not modify data unnecessarily.\n6. Use QPI functions consistently throughout the code.\n7. Use descriptive comments consistently throughout the code.\n8. Use unique IDs consistently throughout the code.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, the contract can be made more secure, efficient, and maintainable.",
