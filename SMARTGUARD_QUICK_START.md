# SmartGuard Qubic Integration - Quick Start Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ For SmartGuard Developers

This is your **complete solution** for adding real Qubic contract execution to the SmartGuard audit platform.

### Current State (Before Integration)
Your SmartGuard platform has a `compile_and_run_qubic` function that returns static simulation results.

### Target State (After Integration)  
Your SmartGuard platform will have **real Qubic contract compilation, deployment, and execution**.

## âš¡ 5-Minute Integration

### Step 1: Copy the Integration File

Copy `qubic_real_execution.py` to your SmartGuard project directory (same level as your main application files).

### Step 2: Update Your Import

Find your QuBIC node file (likely `src/langgraphagenticai/nodes/qubicdocs_nodes.py`) and update the import:

```python
# OLD (static simulation):
def compile_and_run_qubic(state: SmartContractState) -> SmartContractState:
    # ... static simulation code

# NEW (real execution):
from qubic_real_execution import compile_and_run_qubic_real as compile_and_run_qubic

# Your existing function signature remains the same!
# The integration is a drop-in replacement.
```

### Step 3: Test the Integration

Run the validation script:

```powershell
python smartguard_production_validation.py
```

You should see all tests pass.

### Step 4: Deploy

Your SmartGuard platform now has real Qubic execution! No other changes needed.

## ðŸ”§ API Compatibility

The integration maintains **100% API compatibility** with your existing SmartGuard code:

```python
# Your existing SmartGuard function signature:
def compile_and_run_qubic(state: SmartContractState) -> SmartContractState:
    pass

# Our drop-in replacement has the exact same signature:
def compile_and_run_qubic_real(state: SmartContractState) -> SmartContractState:
    pass
```

## ðŸ“Š What Changes for Users

### Before (Static Simulation)
- Users see: "Compiling... OK" (hardcoded)
- No real compilation errors detected
- No actual blockchain interaction
- Limited audit value

### After (Real Execution)
- Users see: Real compiler output with actual errors/warnings
- Real network interaction attempts
- Actual bytecode generation and validation
- Full audit platform capability

## ðŸ›  Customization Options

If you need to customize the integration for your specific SmartGuard setup:

```python
from qubic_real_execution import RealQubicDevKit

# Custom configuration
qdk = RealQubicDevKit(
    timeout=60,  # Adjust timeout for your needs
    qubic_cli_path="/custom/path/to/qubic-cli"  # Custom CLI path
)

# Use in your SmartGuard workflow
def compile_and_run_qubic(state):
    result = qdk.compile_contract(state.contract_code)
    # ... your custom logic
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
- Ensure `qubic_real_execution.py` is in your Python path
- Check that the file was copied correctly

### "Qubic CLI not found" error  
- The integration includes a pre-built qubic-cli for Windows
- Verify the `qubic-cli/` directory exists

### Network timeout errors
- This is expected if not connected to Qubic testnet
- The integration handles this gracefully for SmartGuard users

## ðŸ“ˆ Benefits for SmartGuard

1. **Real Audit Capability**: Actual contract analysis instead of simulation
2. **Better User Experience**: Real compiler feedback and error detection  
3. **Competitive Advantage**: Only audit platform with real Qubic execution
4. **Future-Proof**: Ready for Qubic mainnet and ecosystem growth

## ðŸŽ‰ You're Done!

Your SmartGuard platform now provides real Qubic smart contract compilation and execution. Users will get actual blockchain interaction instead of static simulation.

For technical details, see `README_QUBIC_INTEGRATION.md`.
For validation, run `smartguard_production_validation.py`.
